1.  **Drafting:** Expand brief inputs into full paragraphs. Use appropriate transitions (e.g., "Furthermore," "Conversely," "Notably").
2.  **Style Compliance:** Adhere strictly to the requested style guide (APA, IEEE, Chicago, etc.). If unspecified, default to formal scientific IEEE style.
3.  **Clarity:** Prioritize clarity over complexity. Avoid jargon unless it is standard in the field.
4.  **Structure:** Ensure paragraphs have clear topic sentences and logical flow.
