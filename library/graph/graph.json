However, \nunderstanding fairness within a robust feedback loop, as it occurs in real-world settings, \nremains elusive. This study examines the interplay between popularity bias, calibration, \naccuracy, and beyond-accuracy performance of recommender systems using a novel dy -\nnamic feedback loop framework. The framework models iterative interactions between \nrecommendation algorithms and user profiles, enabling the analysis of calibration, accu -\nracy, and beyond-accuracy measures across user groups with varying preferences on popu-\nlar items, i.e., Popular-, Diverse-, and Niche-focused. Empirical evaluations conducted \non two benchmark datasets using three collaborative filtering algorithms reveal distinct \ndisparities in how feedback loops affect different user groups. Niche-focused users, despite \nbeing the most active and information-rich, experience the steepest deterioration in system \nalignment over time, losing much of their initial calibration, long-tail exposure, and di -\nversity advantages, along with proportional declines in accuracy. These results show that \nfeedback dynamics progressively misalign the system with its most valuable users, making \nthem the most disadvantaged over time. Popular-focused users remain most aligned with \nalgorithmic tendencies, achieving steady accuracy gains but remaining confined to narrow, \npopularit",

Existing methods fall into two categories: tuning \nand non-tuning. While tuning strategies offer better task alignment, they are expensive and require specialized \ntraining. Non-tuning strategies are easier to deploy but often lack task-specific knowledge, limiting their \neffectiveness.\nObjective: This study aims to enhance the recommendation quality of non-tuning LLM-based systems by \naddressing their lack of task awareness.\nMethod: We propose a novel approach, Critique-based LLMs as Recommendation Systems (Critic-LLM-RS), \nwhich introduces an independent machine learning model\u2014the Recommendation Critic\u2014to provide feedback \non LLM-generated recommendations and guide the LLM toward improved recommendation strategies.\nResults: Experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that Critic-LLM-RS significantly outperforms \nexisting non-tuning approaches, regardless of whether open-source or proprietary LLMs are used.\nConclusion: Critic-LLM-RS enhances the task adaptability of non-tuning LLMs through a collaborative feedback \nmechanism, offering a new solution for building efficient and easily deployable recommendation systems.\n1.
